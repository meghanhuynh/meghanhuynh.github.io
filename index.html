    <h2><center>Language</center></h2>
    <p><font size="5"><div style="margin-left: 10em;">
    Dropbox implements their services with a mixture of Python and C code. 
    Python is primarily used in their server backend desktop client, website 
    controller logic, API backend, and analytics. Python allows Dropbox to 
    run on a single code base which allows Dropbox to run on popular operating 
    systems such as Windows, Mac, and Linux. While Python is one of the simpler 
    languages and fairly easy to learn, it comes with a few problems. Scripting 
    languages like Python are not intended to manage memory directly so the code
    can cause memory fragmentation and inefficient use of memory. To improve 
    memory usage that users depend on, Dropbox created a custom allocator that 
    would free memory for future storage.  </div></font></p>
    
    <h2><center>Servers</center></h2>
    <p><font size="5"><div style="margin-left: 10em;">
    Dropbox uses Amazon web services such as elastic compute cloud (EC2), simple 
    storage service (S3), simple queue service (SQS) and domain name system (Route 53). 
    Amazon EC2 and S3 are used for storing and serving file blocks, where EC2 allows 
    the data centers to communicate with the S3. There are also large data centers to 
    manage ten thousand physical servers that store and serve metadata for the billions 
    of files Dropbox saves every day. The metadata is stored in the data centers while 
    the files are transferred to the Amazon S3. Below is an illustration of how Dropbox
    services its clients. </div></font></p>

    <h2><center>Security</center></h2>
    <p><font size="5"><div style="margin-left: 10em;">
    Dropbox has multiple layers of protections: secure data transfer, encryption, network
    configuration and application and user level controls. To protect moving file data, 
    Dropbox uses SSL/TLS for file transfer, creating a secure tunnel protected by 128-bit 
    or higher AES encryption. Dropbox file data is stored in discrete file blocks that are 
    fragmented and encrypted using 256-bit AES. Two-step verification is also available for
    users to protect themselves at login through time-based one-time password (TOTP) applications.
    Dropbox also provides a technology called LAN sync, which allows computers on a local area 
    network to securely download files locally from each other instead of having to contact the 
    central servers.</div></font></p>
    
    <h2><center>Future & Open Source Code</center></h2>
    <p><font size="5"><div style="margin-left: 10em;">
    Dropbox is constantly working to improve service for its users, from becoming more memory 
    efficient to becoming more accessible. It has developed custom code to manage memory with a Python 
    and C coded environment and has implemented their own LAN sync service to speed up user syncing. 
    Employees at Dropbox are increasing the speed even further through streaming file synchronization 
    which is estimated to double the speed of syncing across devices. This type of syncing will become
    very important as Dropbox expands its service across devices. Currently, Dropbox is working on a 
    JIT-based Python implementation, called 
    <a href="http://blog.pyston.org/"> Pyston </a>, to support domains dominated by traditional system 
    languages like C++. More details can be found in their 
    <a href="https://github.com/dropbox/pyston"> Github </a> open source code along with already 
    used software for their multiple platform applications.
