    <h1>Thinking Outside the Dropbox</h1>
    <h2> Written by Meghan Huynh </h2>
    
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    
    <h2>Backend</h2>
    <p>Dropbox uses a mixed coding environment of Python and C code. 
    Python is primarily used in their server backend desktop client, 
    website controller logic, API backend, and analytics. 
    Python allows Dropbox to run on a single code base which allows 
    Dropbox to run on popular operating systems such as Windows, 
    Mac, and Linux. While the simplicity and ease of learning of 
    Python helps Dropbox attract more developers, it comes with a few problems. 
    Scripting languages like Python are not intended to manage memory directly 
    so the code may cause memory fragmentation and inefficient use of memory. 
    Dropboxâ€™s solution to the memory problem was to create a custom allocator 
    in C that would free memory for future storage. </p>
