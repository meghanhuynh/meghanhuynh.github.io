    <h2><center>Language</center></h2>
    <p><font size="5"><div style="margin-left: 20em;">
    Dropbox uses a mixed coding environment of Python and C code. 
    Python is primarily used in their server backend desktop client, 
    website controller logic, API backend, and analytics. 
    Python allows Dropbox to run on a single code base which allows 
    Dropbox to run on popular operating systems such as Windows, 
    Mac, and Linux. While the simplicity and ease of learning of 
    Python helps Dropbox attract more developers, it comes with a few problems. 
    Scripting languages like Python are not intended to manage memory directly 
    so the code may cause memory fragmentation and inefficient use of memory. 
    Dropbox’s solution to the memory problem was to create a custom allocator 
    in C that would free memory for future storage. </div></font></p>
    
    <h2><center>Servers</center></h2>
    <p><font size="5">Dropbox uses Amazon’s EC2/S3 for storing and serving file blocks, 
    in addition to SQS and Route 53. There are also large data centers to 
    manage ten thousand physical servers that store and serve metadata for 
    the billions of files Dropbox saves every day. User Metadata is stored 
    in the data centers while the files are transferred to the Amazon simple 
    storage service (S3). Amazon EC2 allows the data centers to communicate 
    with the S3 cloud storage.</font></p>

    <h2><center>Security</center></h2>
    <p><font size="5">Dropbox has multiple layers of protections: secure data transfer, 
    encryption, network configuration and application and user level controls. 
    To protect moving file data, Dropbox uses SSL/TLS for file transfer, creating 
    a secure tunnel protected by 128-bit or higher AES encryption. Dropbox file 
    data is stored in discrete file blocks that are fragmented and encrypted using 
    256-bit AES. Two-step verification is also available for login security and 
    flags all authentication cookies as secure, and enable HSTS. Dropbox also 
    provides a technology called LAN sync, which allows computers on a local area 
    network to securely download files locally from each other instead of always 
    hitting the central servers.</font></p>
    
    <h2><center>Future & Open Source Code</center></h2>
    <p><font size="5">Dropbox is constantly working to improve service for its users and to become  
    accessible on all devices. It has developed custom code to manage memory 
    with a Python and C coded environment. Most of their developing projects can be 
    found online through open source code.

            – improving the speed of syncing across devices by 2x. 
        <br><b><a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2014/04/introducing-pyston-an-upcoming-jit-based-python-implementation/">Pyston</a></b> 
            – JIT-based python implementation to push python into domains dominated by 
            traditional system languages like C++. <br> Python is relatively new compared to languages 
            like C++ so conversion make it possible for a variety of older systems to support Dropbox.
